# Basics of Java

Java is an object-oriented programming language known for its capability to run on a variety of platforms. It offers robustness, portability, and high performance, making it suitable for web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, games, and server-side applications.

## Key Features of Java

- **Platform Independence:** Java programs are designed to be written once and run anywhere ("Write Once, Run Anywhere").
- **Object-Oriented:** Java is fundamentally object-oriented, offering reusability, flexibility, and extensibility.
- **Automatic Memory Management:** Java automates memory management through garbage collection.

## A Simple Java Program

Let's look at the basic structure of a Java program. Below is a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
